  "Pure-function domain logic for the imitation-jewellery-workshop
  plant-operations coordination actor -- equipment/batch verification,
  shipment-quantity recompute, base-metal-type validation, plating-
  thickness plausibility validation, batch-weight plausibility
  validation, defect-rate plausibility validation, and draft
  maintenance-schedule/shipment-coordination record construction.

  Per docs/adr/0001-architecture.md Decision 1: this vertical has NO
  pre-existing `kotoba-lang/imitjewellerymfg`-style capability library
  to wrap (verified: no such repo exists, and no `jewel`/`jewelry`/
  `jewellery`-named repo exists in kotoba-lang either beyond the
  unrelated `kotoba-lang/com-baker-hughes-jewel` oilfield-services
  JewelSuite integration, via GitHub code/repo search). The domain
  logic therefore lives here as pure functions, re-verified
  INDEPENDENTLY by `imitjewellerymfg.governor` -- the same 'ground
  truth, not self-report' discipline every sibling actor's own
  registry establishes (most directly `jewellerymfg.registry` from
  `cloud-itonami-isic-3211`, this vertical's closest domain analog):
  never trust a proposal's own self-reported quantity/status when the
  inputs needed to recompute it independently are already on record.

  This namespace is pure data + pure functions -- no I/O, no network
  call to any real workshop-operations system. It builds the DRAFT
  record a workshop coordinator would keep (a scheduled equipment
  maintenance window, a coordinated shipment), not the act of
  actuating casting/plating-line equipment or dispatching a real
  freight carrier, and never the act of issuing a materials-safety/
  lead-content-compliance certification (this actor NEVER does any of
  those -- see README `What this actor does NOT do`).

  SCOPE: ISIC 3212 covers manufacture of imitation jewellery and
  related articles -- base-metal casting (rings/chains/bracelets/
  pendants/earrings in zinc-alloy/brass/copper/nickel-silver/
  stainless-steel), plating (gold/silver/rhodium flash or standard
  plating over the base metal), and finishing lines producing finished
  costume/fashion jewellery. Unlike ISIC 3211 (precious-metal
  jewellery), this vertical's central regulatory concern is NOT
  hallmarking/purity-assay of a precious metal -- it is materials
  safety: base-metal alloys and plating baths can carry lead/cadmium
  content subject to consumer-product restricted-substance limits
  (e.g. children's-product lead limits, REACH-style restricted-
  substance regimes for jewellery), and plating chemistry (acid/
  cyanide-based plating baths) is itself a workplace hazard. This
  actor coordinates the back-office record-keeping around that
  workshop (production-batch logging, maintenance scheduling, safety-
  concern flagging, shipment coordination) -- it never touches the
  casting/plating equipment directly, and it never stands in for the
  accredited testing laboratory that certifies a batch's materials-
  safety/lead-content compliance.")
